This is a research project I did in my university AI course (Nov 2024)

This work introduces the fundamentals of supervised machine learning, focusing on the structure and functionality of a single artificial neural node and an entire neural network.
It explores various types of artificial neural nodes and their roles within the network.
Additionally, it provides an in-depth examination of the training process for supervised learning models, highlighting key algorithms such as the perceptron rule and backpropagation.
This comprehensive overview offers a foundational understanding of supervised machine learning and its underlying mechanisms.
